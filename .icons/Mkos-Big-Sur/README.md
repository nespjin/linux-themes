# Mkos Big Sur

Icon set that imitate look to the icons of the new apple operating system version 11, created 100% in inkscape, no blurry backgrounds, instead I use the gradient tool and the technique of repeating multiple transparent images to give the same effect, this to ensure correct representation in all desktop environments, especially those written in qt libraries, As of beta 0.0.4, png shadows have also been incorporated only when very necessary,
